OVRO-LWA mnc_python documentation
======================================

The OVRO-LWA Monitor and Control system provides access to analog, digital, and computing systems. This is used to support a range of users, such as Observer on Duty (OoD), engineers, and science users.

Major subsystems include: ARX, F-engines, X-engines, and Cal-Im cluster. Many subsystems have additional monitor and control software written by subsystem designers. mnc_python provides a simple, high-level access to those subsystems via python.
